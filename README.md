## 🍕 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run several scripts to keep things cooking. Here’s the lowdown:

### 🚀 `npm start`

Fire up the app in development mode! Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your pizza masterpiece in action.

- **Live Reloading:** Make changes and watch them appear instantly. No need to refresh!
- **Linting Alerts:** Catch and fix code issues right in the console.

### 🧪 `npm test`

Run tests to make sure everything's working perfectly.

- **Interactive Testing:** Tests run in watch mode, giving you immediate feedback.
- **Stay Informed:** Know exactly what's passing and what's not.

### 🔨 `npm run build`

Time to go live? Build your app for production!

- **Optimized Build:** React is bundled in production mode for peak performance.
- **Minified Code:** Smaller file sizes with minification and hashed filenames.
- **Deployment Ready:** Your app is now ready to be shared with the world!

### ⚙️ `npm run eject`

Need full control? Eject for complete configuration access.

- **One-Way Ticket:** Ejecting is permanent. Proceed with caution!
- **Full Customization:** Access and tweak configuration files and dependencies.
- **Total Control:** Tailor the setup exactly to your needs.

Remember, you don’t have to eject to use the app. The default setup is perfect for most use cases. But if you need that extra control, it’s there for you!
